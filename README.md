# Search-Feature-Flutter
For this challenge I would like you to implement a sample of a functional front-end for a small portion of one of our modules in the app - the Admin module and I simply would want to implement the search aspect of it. I use dummy data for the users Iâ€™d search for. I only need to implement enough to illustrate that the feature works.
